<h4>Salve! Habeas diem bonum. Quam triste est nolle linguam Latinam cognoscere. (I need to retake my Latin haha. I had to think and look at my dictionary way too much XD) <br><br>I don't think I'll be doing "Good Mornings" my love. It's too much a tempation for direct communication, but I wanted thank you for your "good night." I will treasure it always, my sweet and loving boy. God Bless you today. I love you so much. Do your math test btw. <br><br>There was some distressing news yesterday for every high schooler in the the US. Trump made a deal with China and is admitting 600,000 foreign students. 600,000! It will be much harder for American students to get into the coveted "top universities." My dad found it distressing. I'm glad that he admits Trump's blunder on this. Ironic since I was doing some college research yesterday. I'm looking specifically for schools with less-competitive acceptance rates, are not located in big cities, have good engineering programs, and perhaps most importantly, are not crazy expensive.<br><br>I hosted a meeting this morning. After that, I chatted for quite a bit with Marta from CH who also happens to be in my team for this competition. I emailed a couple of organizations. As of now, I'm doing the physics problems I ignored yesterday.
