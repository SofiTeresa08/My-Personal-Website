<h4>I'm primarily focused on schoolwork at the moment. Or in fact, studying for the SAT. I studied so much in English that my English score was actually higher than my Math score! I took a practice test and got 1440/1600, which is not optimal since I am a  perfectionist. I'm also interviewing with a whole bunch of organizations to offer to build an app for them for the 2026 Technovation Girls Competition. Reading "A Gentleman in Moscow" by Amor Towles. I'm trying to curate a melancholy classical playlist on Spotify, that's what I've been listening to. I'm also listenting to Laufey's new album 'A Matter of Time', my favorite song from it is "Lover Girl". Perfect fit for the summer.</h4>

<h4>Salve! Habeas diem bonum. Quam tristem est non velle linguam Latina cognoscere. <br> I don't think I'll be doing "Good Mornings" my love. It's too much a tempation for direct communication, but I wanted thank you for your "good night". I will treasure it always, my sweet and loving boy. God Bless you today. I love you so much. Do your math test btw. <br> There was some distressing news yesterday for every high schooler in the the U.S. Trump made a deal with China and is admitting 600,000 foreign students. 600,000! It will be much harder for American students to get into the coveted "top universities." My dad found it distressing. I'm glad that he admits Trump's blunder on this. Ironic since I was doing some college research yesterday. I'm looking specifically for schools with less-competitive acceptance rates, are not located in big cities, have good engineering programs, and perhaps most importantly, are not crazy expensive.
