<h4>I miss a very special someone very much. There was once a young boy with a very curious mind who from time to time discovered a new obsession, whether it was vultures, paper airplanes, or chess. And when he was a nobody on his chess account, there was a high-rated Brazilian account who played with him, gave him advice, and encouraged him. His older sister watched in marvel as he idolized this Ghost in a way that could almost be reckoned to a girl's first love. When the child would win a game, he would proudly say, "Ghost_Alekhine was right, my brain is better than hints." He would sit on the couch and watch his hero's games while his sister played the piano. He lived simply for the Ghost's praise that he was getting better. One day, he came to his sister in tears saying that the Ghost was no longer his friend. The account disappeared, but never the memory of the Ghost. It broke his sister's heart to see that even after so much time, the young boy would still sit on the couch and watch the epic games of his hero. One night she overheard him telling their younger brother about how he was going to grow up and be as good as the Ghost and beat Magnus's bot. And on the day she was most brokenhearted, she saw the boy type "Ghost_Alekhine" on the challenge a player function, as if by some chance the boy believed he could find a glitch in the system and bring back his hero. His sister hugged him, and wanted to say so badly, "I lost my hero too."</h4>

<h4>I'm primarily focused on schoolwork at the moment. Or in fact, studying for the SAT. I studied so much in English that my English score was actually higher than my Math score! I took a practice test and got 1440/1600, which is not optimal since I am a  perfectionist. I'm also interviewing with a whole bunch of organizations to offer to build an app for them for the 2026 Technovation Girls Competition. Reading "A Gentleman in Moscow" by Amor Towles. I'm trying to curate a melancholy classical playlist on Spotify, that's what I've been listening to. I'm also listenting to Laufey's new album 'A Matter of Time', my favorite song from it is "Lover Girl". Perfect fit for the summer.</h4>

<h4>I'm doing the 2025 Pathways for Girls Who Code! I have really enjoyed practicing my coding skills. I found data analysis pretty fun. My greatest interest so far has been working in Python and also Cryptography. This website was built as a project for the program!<br>Here is another of my favorite projects so far: <a href="https://replit.com/@sc-25/Programming-Caesars-Cipher-Starter-Code-SC?v=1">Caesar's Cipher</a>
